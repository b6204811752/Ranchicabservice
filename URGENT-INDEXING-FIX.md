## 🔍 WHY Your Pages Aren't Indexed

### Main Reasons:

1. **New Website** - You launched ~10 days ago. Google needs 2-4 weeks to fully index new sites.

2. **Limited Crawl Budget** - New sites get crawled slowly. Requesting indexing speeds this up.

3. **Missing Route Pages** - You have only 1 route page. Your competitors have 20-50 route pages.

4. **Weak Internal Links** - Pages with few internal links are harder for Google to find.

5. **Thin Content on Some Pages** - Legal pages (Privacy, Terms) have minimal content.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed for You

### 1. Updated Sitemap.xml ✅
- Changed lastmod date to 2026-02-01 (today)
- Ensured all 13 pages are included
- Added image sitemap namespace for better crawling

### 2. Sitemap Now Includes:
- ✅ Homepage (/)
- ✅ About (/about)
- ✅ Services (/services)  
- ✅ Local Taxi (/local-taxi-ranchi)
- ✅ Outstation Taxi (/outstation-taxi)
- ✅ Airport Taxi (/airport-taxi)
- ✅ Corporate Taxi (/corporate-taxi)
- ✅ Fleet (/fleet)
- ✅ Cities (/cities)
- ✅ Contact (/contact)
- ✅ Ranchi to Patna Route (/ranchi-to-patna-cab)
- ✅ Privacy Policy (/privacy-policy)
- ✅ Terms & Conditions (/terms-conditions)

**Total: 13 URLs** (Previously: 12 URLs)
