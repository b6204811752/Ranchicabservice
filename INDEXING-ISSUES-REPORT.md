## 🚨 WHY 20 PAGES ARE NOT INDEXED

Based on Google Search Console data, pages may not be indexed for these reasons:

### 1. **Crawl Budget & New Website**
- Your website is relatively new (launched ~10 days ago)
- Google allocates limited crawl budget to new websites
- It takes 2-4 weeks for full indexing of a new site

### 2. **Duplicate Content Detection**
- Similar content across multiple pages may trigger duplicate content filters
- Pages with thin or duplicate content get deprioritized

### 3. **Missing Internal Links**
- Pages with few internal links are harder for Google to discover
- Check if all 13 pages have proper navigation links

### 4. **Low Content Quality**
- Pages with less than 300 words may be considered "thin content"
- Legal pages (Privacy, Terms) often have this issue

### 5. **Technical SEO Issues**
- Missing or weak H1 tags
- Poor mobile responsiveness
- Slow page load times
- JavaScript rendering issues (React apps)
